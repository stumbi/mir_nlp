    "In the following weeks, we will explore an NLP pipeline for preprocessing a dataset of clinical patient notes with the goal of classifying them according to 40 different medical specialities, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neurology\n",
    "* Cardiovascular/Pulmonary\n",
    "* Psychiatry/Psychology\n",
    "* Obstetrics /Gynecology\n",
    "* Nephrology\n",
    "* Radiology\n",
    "* and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will cover various techniques and tools commonly used in NLP, including text preprocessing, tokenization, Stemming/Lemmatization, Stop word analysis Part-of-speech tagging etc. in order to preprocess the data for the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided to you contains a collection of medical transcriptions that includes information on the patients conditions. Your task will be to extract useful information from these notes in order to classify them according to which medical speciality this patient belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will have gained a solid understanding of the NLP pipeline for clinical patient note classification and will have hands-on experience with various NLP techniques and tools. You will also be able to apply your knowledge to real-world NLP problems not only in the medical domain.\n",
